# Content of the repository

Python notebooks can be found in the `src_EN` directory:

- `EX.ipynb` are exercices
- `EX-COR.ipynb` are exercice corrections
- other files are the course itself

The build directory contains material to build the entire PDF file `build/main.pdf`:

- `main.ipynb` converts the notebooks to LaTex files
   Requires `nbconvert`
- `main.tex` organize these .tex files to build a single document
   Requires a valid tex installation
