    "- classical Python exceptions, as introduced previously\n",
    "- inconsistent scientific results that sugget a code error\n",
    "\n",
    "The *__debugger__* is a tool that makes solving these problems an easier task. Using the debugger, one can pause running code at some given instructions, called *__breakpoints__*. Whenever a breakpoint is encountered, the user can:\n",

    "- observe the some variable values (local or global variables)\n",
    "- evaluate some new expressions using these variables\n",

    "The native debugger of Python is a library called `pdb`. Whenever the `set_trace` method is used to declare breakpoints, execution falls back to debug mode. \n",

    "Yet, `pdb` is not handy, and a much better debugger integration is done within recent IDE. In this part, the debugger of _Visual Studio Code_ is introduced."
