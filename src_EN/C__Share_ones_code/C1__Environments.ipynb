    "    1. some packages exist only on the [official Python package repository, called PyPi](https://pypi.org/). Those must be installed using `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        __In a conda environment__, it is strongly unrecommend to mix conda and pip packages (though it's possible). The prefered procedure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - whenever it's possible, install the conda version of the package\n",
    "        - install the pip version when there is no other choice\n",
    "        - try to avoid conda packages after some pip packages were installed\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. some packages exist only as source code that can be retrieved from shared plateforms such as GitHub or GitLab \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda is not the only way to handle Python environments. Another way is using the [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Pros include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - compatible with pip\n",
    "    - lighter than conda\n",

    "  Yet, managing venv environments is slightly less intuitive than conda environments."
