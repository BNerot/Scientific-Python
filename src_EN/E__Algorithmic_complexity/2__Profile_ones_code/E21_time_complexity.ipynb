    "## Optimisation methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The following methodology can be used to reduce the time complexity of any code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the total running time (timing)\n",
    "2. Sort each function $f$ by running time (profiling)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$t(f)$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Estimate for each function the possible room for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \\Delta t(f)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Optimize the function $f$ for which  $t(f) \\times \\Delta t(f)$ is the smallest.\n",
    "5. Check that the code is still operating properly\n",
    "6. Go back to step 1 if running time is still too high\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If running time is still not satisfactory and no more room exists for improvement, __you must think of another  formulation of your scientific problem__. This is very time consuming, that's why you must wonder whether your formulation is adaptated __before__ writing any code line. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have some code that calls 3 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the first function call is 90% of total running time\n",
    "- the second function call is 1%\n",
    "- the third is 9%\n",
    "\n",
    "__Achieving a 10% time reduction on the first function call (which seems possible) will have more effect than a 90% time reduction on the third call (which seems difficult)__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with some tools to measure the running time of some code instructions. There are 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measuring the total running time: __timing__. \n",
    "\n",
    "   This can be done using the  `timeit` package.\n",
    "2. Measuring the running time of each function call: __profiling__. \n",
    "\n",
    "   This can be done using the  `cProfile` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### _iPython_\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of directly using `timeit` and `cProfile`, it is recommended to use the magick commands __`%timeit`__ and __`%prun`__. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands require the Python shell to be a __*iPython*__ shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "__*iPython*__ can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- by installing the `ipython` package and by opening a shell using the `ipython` command\n",
    "- by installing either Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the magic commands, __*iPython*__ shells come with a better color code and indentation handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case study definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a very naive function and analyse its algorithmic complexity. __This function is designed specifically not to be efficient__, it must not be used."
